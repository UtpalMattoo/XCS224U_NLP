        "\n",
        "This notebook illustrates an approach to [relation extraction](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/relation_extraction) using [distant supervision](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/distant_supervision). It uses a simplified version of the approach taken by Mintz et al. in their 2009 paper, [Distant supervision for relation extraction without labeled data](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P09-1113). If you haven't yet read that paper, read it now! The rest of the notebook will make a lot more sense after you're familiar with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The task of relation extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Relation extraction is the task of extracting from natural language text relational triples such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "(founders, SpaceX, Elon_Musk)\n",
        "(has_spouse, Elon_Musk, Talulah_Riley)\n",
        "(worked_at, Elon_Musk, Tesla_Motors)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If we can accumulate a large knowledge base (KB) of relational triples, we can use it to power question answering and other applications. Building a KB manually is slow and expensive, but much of the knowledge we'd like to capture is already expressed in abundant text on the web. The aim of relation extraction, therefore, is to accelerate the construction of new KBs — and facilitate the ongoing curation of existing KBs — by extracting relational triples from natural language text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hand-built patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "An obvious way to start is to write down a few patterns which express each relation. For example, we can use the pattern \"X is the founder of Y\" to find new instances of the `founders` relation. If we search a large corpus, we may find the phrase \"Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX\", which we can use as evidence for the relational triple `(founders, SpaceX, Elon_Musk)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, this approach doesn't get us very far. The central challenge of relation extraction is the fantastic diversity of language, the multitude of possible ways to express a given relation. For example, each of the following sentences expresses the relational triple `(founders, SpaceX, Elon_Musk)`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"You may also be thinking of *Elon Musk* (founder of *SpaceX*), who started PayPal.\"\n",
        "- \"Interesting Fact: *Elon Musk*, co-founder of PayPal, went on to establish *SpaceX*, one of the most promising space travel startups in the world.\"\n",
        "- \"If Space Exploration (*SpaceX*), founded by Paypal pioneer *Elon Musk* succeeds, commercial advocates will gain credibility and more support in Congress.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The patterns which connect \"Elon Musk\" with \"SpaceX\" in these examples are not ones we could have easily anticipated. To do relation extraction effectively, we need to go beyond hand-built patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Supervised learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Effective relation extraction will require applying machine learning methods. The natural place to start is with supervised learning. This means training an extraction model from a dataset of examples which have been labeled with the target output. Sentences like the three examples above would be annotated with the `founders` relation, but we'd also have sentences which include \"Elon Musk\" and \"SpaceX\" but do not express the `founders` relation, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"Billionaire entrepreneur *Elon Musk* announced the latest addition to the *SpaceX* arsenal: the 'Big F---ing Rocket' (BFR)\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Such \"negative examples\" would be labeled as such, and the fully-supervised model would then be able to learn from both positive and negative examples the linguistic patterns that indicate each relation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difficulty with the fully-supervised approach is the cost of generating training data. Because of the great diversity of linguistic expression, our model will need lots and lots of training data: at least tens of thousands of examples, although hundreds of thousands or millions would be much better. But labeling the examples is just as slow and expensive as building the KB by hand would be.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Distant supervision\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of distant supervision is to capture the benefits of supervised learning without paying the cost of labeling training data. Instead of labeling extraction examples by hand, we use existing relational triples to automatically identify extraction examples in a large corpus. For example, if we already have in our KB the relational triple `(founders, SpaceX, Elon_Musk)`, we can search a large corpus for sentences in which \"SpaceX\" and \"Elon Musk\" co-occur, make the (unreliable!) assumption that all the sentences express the `founder` relation, and then use them as training data for a learned model to identify new instances of the `founder` relation — all without doing any manual labeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a powerful idea, but it has two limitations. The first is that, inevitably, some of the sentences in which \"SpaceX\" and \"Elon Musk\" co-occur will not express the `founder` relation — like the BFR example above. By making the blind assumption that all such sentences do express the `founder` relation, we are essentially injecting noise into our training data, and making it harder for our learning algorithms to learn good models. Distant supervision is effective in spite of this problem because it makes it possible to leverage vastly greater quantities of training data, and the benefit of more data outweighs the harm of noisier data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second limitation is that we need an existing KB to start from. We can only train a model to extract new instances of the `founders` relation if we already have many instances of the `founders` relation. Thus, while distant supervision is a great way to extend an existing KB, it's not useful for creating a KB containing new relations from scratch.\n",

        "As usual when we're doing NLP, we need to start with a _corpus_ — a large sample of natural language text. And because our goal is to do relation extraction with distant supervision, we need to be able to identify entities in the text and connect them to a knowledge base of relations between entities. So, we need a corpus in which entity mentions are annotated with _entity resolutions_ which map them to unique, unambiguous identifiers. Entity resolution serves two purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It ensures that if an entity mention could refer to two different entities, it is properly disambiguated. For example, \"New York\" could refer to the city or the state.\n",
        "1. It ensures that if two different entity mentions refer to the same entity, they are properly identified. For example, both \"New York City\" and \"The Big Apple\" refer to New York City.\n",
        "\n",
        "The corpus we'll use for this project is derived from the [Wikilinks dataset](https://code.google.com/archive/p/wiki-links/) [announced by Google in 2013](https://research.googleblog.com/2013/03/learning-from-big-data-40-million.html). This dataset contains over 40M mentions of 3M distinct entities spanning 10M webpages. It provides entity resolutions by mapping each entity mention to a Wikipedia URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, in order to do relation extraction, we actually need _pairs_ of entity mentions, and it's important to have the context around and between the two mentions. Fortunately, UMass has provided an [expanded version of Wikilinks](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/data/data-wiki-links) which includes the context around each entity mention. We've written code to stitch together pairs of entity mentions along with their contexts, and we've filtered the examples extensively. The result is a compact corpus suitable for our purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because we're frequently going to want to retrieve corpus examples containing specific entities, we've created a `Corpus` class which holds not only the examples themselves, but also a precomputed index. Let's take a closer look."

        "\n",
        "Because we've formulated our prediction problem as a family of binary classification problems, one for each relation (label), choosing evaluation metrics is pretty straightforward. The standard metrics for evaluating binary classification are [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall), which are more meaningful than simple accuracy, particularly in problems with a highly biased label distribution (like ours). We'll compute and report precision and recall separately for each relation (label). There are only two wrinkles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __How best to combine precision and recall into a single metric.__ Having two evaluation metrics is often inconvenient. If we're considering a change to our model which improves precision but degrades recall, should we take it? To drive an iterative development process, it's useful to have a single metric on which to hill-climb. For binary classification, the standard answer is the [F<sub>1</sub>-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score), which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. However, the F<sub>1</sub>-score gives equal weight to precision and recall. For our purposes, precision is probably more important than recall. If we're extracting new relation triples from (massively abundant) text on the web in order to augment a knowledge base, it's probably more important that the triples we extract are correct (precision) than that we extract all the triples we could (recall). Accordingly, instead of the F<sub>1</sub>-score, we'll use the F<sub>0.5</sub>-score, which gives precision twice as much weight as recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __How to aggregate metrics across relations (labels).__ Reporting metrics separately for each relation is great, but in order to drive iterative development, we'd also like to have summary metrics which aggregate across all relations. There are two possible ways to do it: _micro-averaging_ will give equal weight to all problem instances, and thus give greater weight to relations with more instances, while _macro-averaging_ will give equal weight to all relations, and thus give lesser weight to problem instances in relations with more instances. Because the number of problem instances per relation is, to some degree, an accident of our data collection methodology, we'll choose macro-averaging.\n",
        "\n",
